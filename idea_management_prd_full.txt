# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Idea Management Platform - Business Case Capture

---

## **Executive Summary**

The Idea Management Platform's Business Case Capture module is designed to help businesses streamline the process of capturing, evaluating, and prioritizing ideas based on structured business case data. By providing a unified interface for idea submission, ROI and effort estimation, risk evaluation, and prioritization, this module will enable organizations to make informed decisions and align innovation efforts with strategic goals.

This PRD outlines the scope, requirements, and implementation details for building this module, ensuring it meets the needs of end-users while maintaining scalability and usability.

## **Problem Statement**

Organizations struggle to capture and evaluate innovative ideas systematically. Current methods (e.g., spreadsheets or email threads) lack structure and make it challenging to:

1. Standardize input data, leading to inconsistent business case evaluations.
2. Prioritize ideas effectively based on ROI, effort, and risk.
3. Enable stakeholders to track, filter, and sort ideas efficiently.
4. Maintain a centralized, searchable, and exportable repository of ideas.

This results in missed opportunities, inefficiencies in innovation management, and a failure to align ideas with business objectives.

## **User Stories**

### **User Story 1: Submit an Idea**
**As a** user,  
**I want to** submit an idea via a structured form,  
**So that** I can provide all relevant business case details in a consistent manner.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Form includes fields for title, description, category/tags, submitter information, and timestamp.
  - Mandatory fields are validated before submission.
  - Upon submission, the idea is saved to the database and assigned a unique ID.

### **User Story 2: Estimate ROI for an Idea**
**As a** user,  
**I want to** provide an ROI estimation, including confidence level and timeframe,  
**So that** stakeholders can evaluate the potential financial impact of the idea.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Fields for ROI value (currency), timeframe (months/years), and confidence level (low/medium/high).
  - ROI value is validated to accept only positive numbers.
  - Default confidence level is "medium" if the user does not select one.

---

### **User Story 3: Assess Effort & Risks**
**As a** user,  
**I want to** specify effort and risk parameters for my idea,  
**So that** stakeholders can understand the resource requirements and potential challenges.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Effort estimation accepts hours or story points.
  - Risk assessment includes dropdown options (low/medium/high) with an optional text field for mitigation plans.
  - Validation ensures mitigation plans are required for "high" risks.

---

### **User Story 4: View and Filter Submitted Ideas**
**As a** stakeholder,  
**I want to** view a searchable, filterable, and sortable database of submitted ideas,  
**So that** I can focus on ideas that meet specific criteria.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Database allows search by title, description, category/tags, and submitter.
  - Filters include status, priority, ROI, and risk levels.
  - Sorting options include ascending/descending by ROI, priority score, and timestamps.

---

### **User Story 5: Export Idea Data**
**As a** stakeholder,  
**I want to** export idea data to CSV, Excel, or PDF,  
**So that** I can share or analyze the data offline.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Export functionality supports CSV, Excel, and PDF formats.
  - Exported file includes all fields and respects applied filters.
  - File is generated and downloadable within 5 seconds for up to 10,000 entries.

  - Submitter Information (auto-filled from logged-in user profile)
  - Timestamp (auto-generated, uneditable)

### **2. Business Case Data**
- ROI Estimation
  - Value (mandatory, numeric, accepts positive decimals)
  - Timeframe (mandatory, dropdown: "1 month," "6 months," "1 year," "2 years")
  - Confidence Level (mandatory, dropdown: low/medium/high)
- Effort Estimation
  - Effort (mandatory, numeric, accepts integers or decimals)
  - Resource Requirements (optional, text area, max 200 characters)
- Risk Assessment
  - Risk Level (mandatory, dropdown: low/medium/high)
  - Mitigation Plans (mandatory if risk = high, text area, max 300 characters)
- Priority Scoring
  - Automatically calculated using an **impact vs effort matrix formula.**

### **3. Idea Database**
- Searchable, filterable, and sortable table/grid.
- Columns:
  - Title, Category/Tags, ROI, Effort, Risk, Priority Score, Submitter, Timestamp
- Filters:
  - Status (e.g., "New," "In Review," "Approved")
  - ROI (range filter)
  - Risk (low/medium/high)
- Sorting:
  - ROI, Priority Score, Timestamp (ascending/descending)

### **4. Export Functionality**
- Export all visible data based on applied filters.
- Supported formats: CSV, Excel, PDF.
- Exported filenames follow this structure: `Ideas_<timestamp>.<file extension>`.

### **5. Notifications**
- Email notification to submitter upon successful idea submission.
- Optional notifications for stakeholders when ideas are submitted in specific categories.

## **Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **Performance**:
   - System must handle up to 1,000 concurrent users without degradation.
   - Data retrieval for the database must complete in under 2 seconds for up to 10,000 rows.

2. **Scalability**:
   - System must be capable of scaling to accommodate 50,000 ideas in the database.

3. **Security**:
   - Data must be encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2 or higher).
   - Role-based access control (e.g., submitters can only edit their own ideas).

4. **Usability**:
   - UI must be responsive and accessible (WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance).

## **Database Schema Suggestions**

### **Tables**

1. **Ideas Table**:
   - `id` (Primary key, UUID)
   - `title` (String, 100 chars)
   - `description` (Text)
   - `category_tags` (Array of strings)
   - `submitter_id` (UUID, foreign key to Users table)
   - `timestamp` (Datetime)
   - `roi_value` (Float)
   - `roi_timeframe` (String)
   - `roi_confidence` (String)
   - `effort_estimation` (Float)
   - `resource_requirements` (Text)
   - `risk_level` (String)
   - `mitigation_plans` (Text)
   - `priority_score` (Float)

2. **Users Table**:
   - `id` (Primary Key, UUID)
   - `name` (String)
   - `email` (String)
   - `role` (Enum: "submitter," "reviewer," "admin")

---

## **Dependencies & Risks**

### Dependencies:
- Authentication service (OAuth/SAML for user logins)
- Email service (e.g., SendGrid for notifications)
- Export library (e.g., jsPDF or SheetJS)

### Risks:
1. **Risk**: Delayed retrieval of large datasets from the database.  
   **Mitigation**: Implement server-side pagination and indexing on searchable fields.

2. **Risk**: Misaligned data due to improper validations.  
   **Mitigation**: Enforce strict input validation on both frontend and backend.

3. **Risk**: Scalability issues with high user traffic.  
   **Mitigation**: Use serverless architecture and load balancing.
